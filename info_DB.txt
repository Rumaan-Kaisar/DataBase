--------    following are databases are popular among data scientists    --------
Several databases are popular among data scientists for various purposes, including storing, querying, and analyzing data. Some of the popular databases used in data science include:

1. **Relational Databases**:
   - MySQL:     An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for web applications and online publishing.
   - PostgreSQL:        Another open-source RDBMS known for its advanced features, extensibility, and SQL compliance.
   - SQLite:        A self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine popular for embedded database applications.
   - Microsoft SQL Server:      A relational database management system developed by Microsoft.


2. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - MongoDB:     A document-oriented NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
   - Cassandra:       A distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.
   - Redis:       An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker, supporting various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.
   - Elasticsearch:       A distributed, RESTful search, and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search.


3. **Graph Databases**:
   - Neo4j: A graph database management system that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.


4. **Time Series Databases**:
   - InfluxDB: An open-source TIME SERIES database designed to handle high write and query loads for metrics and events.


5. **Big Data Technologies**:
   - Apache Hadoop:     A framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
   - Apache Spark:      A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, offering APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R.
   - Apache Hive:       A data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis.


6. **Cloud-Based Databases**:
   - Amazon Redshift: A fully managed data warehouse product offered by Amazon Web Services.
   - Google BigQuery: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data.

The choice of database depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance considerations, and specific use cases in data science projects.




------------    cloud-based databases    ------------
Among cloud-based databases, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers several popular options that are widely used by data scientists:

1. **Amazon Aurora**: 
    Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud. 
    It offers high performance, scalability, and durability. 
    Many data scientists use Aurora for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads.

2. **Amazon Redshift**: 
    Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that is designed for analytics workloads. 
    It is optimized for querying and analyzing large datasets using SQL, 
        making it popular among data scientists for data warehousing and business intelligence applications.

3. **Amazon DynamoDB**: 
    Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. 
    It is commonly used by data scientists for real-time applications, IoT (Internet of Things) data storage, and mobile backends.

4. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: 
    Amazon RDS is a fully managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines, 
        including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and MariaDB. 
    Data scientists often use RDS for deploying and managing relational databases in the cloud.

5. **Amazon Neptune**: 
    Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service that is optimized for storing and querying highly connected data. 
    It is commonly used for social networking applications, recommendation engines, and 
    network analysis, making it popular among data scientists working with graph data.

These AWS cloud-based databases offer scalability, reliability, and ease of use, 
    making them attractive options for data scientists who want to leverage cloud infrastructure for their data storage and analysis needs.




----------------    SQL    ----------------
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.

    It is used for:
            storing, 
            retrieving, 
            updating, and 
            deleting data 
    in a relational database management system (RDBMS). 


    SQL provides a set of commands and syntax for interacting with databases, 
        allowing users to perform various operations such as creating and modifying database schemas, 
        querying data from tables, and executing transactions.    



Following are examples of popular SQL databases:

1. MySQL: 
    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for 
        web applications and other data-driven software. 
    It is known for its ease of use, scalability, and performance.

2. PostgreSQL: 
    PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source object-relational database system known for its robust feature set, 
        extensibility, and standards compliance. 
    It is suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large enterprise systems.

3. Microsoft SQL Server: 
    Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. 
    It is widely used in enterprise environments and integrates well with other Microsoft products and technologies.

4. Oracle Database: 
    Oracle Database is a comprehensive relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation. 
    It is known for its reliability, scalability, and advanced features, making it a popular choice for large-scale enterprise applications.


Among these databases, 
        "MySQL" and 
        "PostgreSQL" 
    are often considered the most popular choices for general-purpose applications, 

while Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database are commonly used in enterprise environments.
